menu items to allow users to learn them as they continue to access a menu item.You could read the list and select an item from it the way that you choose a dish at a restaurant by reading the menu.It is just as likely that a user will select an item, scroll it into invisibility, then spot a more desirable second item and select it expecting the first―unseen―item to automatically be deselected because the control is mutually exclusive. You get to choose between offending the first half of your users or the second half.Figure 22-2: A menu item reading Format Gallery is likely to be more enlightening to new users than a butcon like this one.Unfortunately, that pie chart isn’t built into the Explorer’s interface. Instead, you have to seek it out with a menu item.If you wanted to change an item, such as your address, first you explicitly had to ask the application permission to change it.The dialog box enabled the software designer to encapsulate all the subchoices of any menu item within a single, interactive container.Earmarking is a solution to this. Put check boxes next to each text item and use them instead of selection to indicate the user’s choices.First of all, ToolTips have a well-timed lag that displays the helpful information only after a user has dwelled on the item for a second or so.concerned plural singular twoadd apply balance bid choose contain enact have in import neednext following first main personal particular selected last single majorbuy have find sell list purchase add use want choose---------------------end----------------------In a typical interaction, a user quickly refers to his daily calendar or adds an item to his to-do list while sitting at a stop light. Cellular telephones are an interesting type of handheld device.New users can see that multiple command vectors exist and that there is an easy-to-find resource for learning them. All programs should have this Shortcut item.However, color is much more than a marketing checklist item; it is a powerful information and visual interface design tool that can be used to great effect, or just as easily abused.You should be vigilant in finding and rooting out each small item of excise in your interface. These myriad little extra unnecessary steps can add up to a lot of extra work for users.If you ask a good shop clerk for help locating an item, he will not only answer the question, but also volunteer useful collateral information; for example, the fact that a more expensive, higher-quality item than the one you requested is currently on sale for a similar price.concerned plural singular twoadd apply balance bid choose contain enact have in import neednext following first main personal particular selected last single majorbuy have find sell list purchase add use want choose---------------------end----------------------You click the mouse button on a menu bar item to make the menu appear; then―while still holding down the button―you drag down the menu and release the mouse button on your choice.If the application is more complex and sophisticated, the menu space will be sorely needed, and opening and scrolling through a menu to find the right item may become laborious.Most designers use other idioms to add list items: Click a button or select a menu item and a new, blank entry is added to the list and the user can then edit-in-place its name.Visual excise is the work that a user has to do to decode visual information, such as finding a single item in a list, figuring out where to begin reading on a screen, or determining which elements on it are clickable and which are merely decoration.To select an item on the menu, all you had to do was read it and type in its first letter preceded by a slash. Submenus then replaced the main menu on the top line.If you pick up an item in the list but the place you need to drop it is currently scrolled out of view, you must be able to scroll the listview without putting down the dragged object.After daily use, for example, we no longer really read the menus, but find what we need by recognizing patterns: Pull down the second menu and select the bottom-most item in the next-to-last section.They also provide a helpful visual connection to other controls that do the same task. In order to create a strong visual language, a menu item should show the same icon as the corresponding toolbar butcon.One thing sorely lacking on most Help menus is an item labeled Shortcuts that explains how to go beyond relying on the menus. It could offer pointers on more powerful idioms such as accelerators, toolbar buttons, and direct-manipulation idioms.concerned plural singular twoadd apply balance bid choose contain enact have in import neednext following first main personal particular selected last single majorbuy have find sell list purchase add use want choose---------------------end----------------------If we were to add a check box to every item in our problematic list control, the user would not only clearly see which items were selected and which were not, he would also clearly see that the items were not mux-linked, solving both of our problems in one stroke.It can be extremely daunting to find a useful visual metaphor for changing channels, purchasing an item, finding a reference, setting a format, changing a photograph’s resolution, or performing statistical analysis, yet these operations are precisely the type of processes we use software to perform most frequently.Little work has been done historically to enable users to make direct text entry into an item in a list control. Of course, the need to enter text where text is output is widespread, and much of the kludginess of dialog box design can be directly attributed to programmers trying to dodge the bullet of having to write edit-in-place code.As the name implies, it is a menu title―directly on the menu bar next to other menu titles―that behaves like a menu item. Rather than displaying a drop-down menu for subsequent selection, the bang menu causes a function to execute right away!Ultimately, the use of folders or directories as a primary retrieval mechanism requires that users know where an item has been stored in order to locate it. This is unfortunate, since digital systems are capable of providing us with significantly better methods of finding information than those physically possible using mechanical systems.Many applications also use the status bar that goes across the bottom of their main window to display an even longer line of explanatory text associated with the currently selected menu item. This idiom can enhance the teaching value of the command vector―if a user knows to look for it. The location ensures that such information will often go unnoticed.The File menu’s name is the result of implementation model thinking about how our operating systems work, the Edit menu is based on a very weak clipboard, and the Help menu is frequently not terribly helpful and often only contains a single item that is actually directly related to helping users.concerned plural singular twoadd apply balance bid choose contain enact have in import neednext following first main personal particular selected last single majorbuy have find sell list purchase add use want choose---------------------end----------------------Fresh evidence, the smallest item, is a champion to speak for it.There' s an important news item / item of news in today' s paper.今天报上有一则重要新闻.He ticked off each item on the list.pick any nameable item挑出任何说得出名称的物品One or sometimes a bidirectional pair of buttons placed between them allows items to be selected and transferred from one box to the other, as shown in Figure 21-13. It is so much more pleasant when the idiom is buttressed with the capability to just click and drag the desired item from one box to another without having to go through the intermediate steps of selection and function invocation.One of the features missing from almost every help system is a shortcuts option. It is an item in the Help menu that, when selected, shows in digest form all the tools and keyboard commands for the program’s various features.Please verify each item you have pricked down.concerned plural singular twoadd apply balance bid choose contain enact have in import neednext following first main personal particular selected last single majorbuy have find sell list purchase add use want choose---------------------end----------------------He could imagine poor old Fred Damdy reading that item avidly.Oh, no sir.

Narrative also lends itself to effective visual depictions of interactive products.Because of this, the overview area should itself be persistent; its content is dependent on the data being navigated.The next time you find your application asking your users a question, make it ask itself one instead.Of course we’re sure; otherwise, we wouldn’t have asked. It shouldn’t second-guess us or itself.Directing your attention to the interaction itself puts the emphasis on the side effects of the tools and technology rather than on the user’s goals.---------------------end----------------------The primary risk of any standard is that the product that follows it is only as good as the standard itself.Static object hinting is when the pliancy of an object is communicated by the static rendering of the object itself.However, if a user drags too far from the scrollbar, it resets itself to the position it was in before being clicked on.They will also want to tune the program itself for speed and ease, but in all cases, the level of custom configuration will be light to moderate.Why can’t the program, if it knows what the user must type, just enter xxxx by itself and save the user the tongue-lashing?The house itself is represented by the application’s main window, and each room is a pane, document window, or dialog box.If you ask an application to perform a function itself, the application should simply perform that function and not interrogate you about your precise configuration details.These include most hardware-management tasks that the computer could handle itself, like telling an application which COM port to use.---------------------end----------------------If a user drags the toolbar away from the edge, it configures itself as a floating toolbar, complete with a mini title bar, as shown in Figure 23-4.These tools should be intimately integrated into the workspace itself in the same way that the conventional artist arranges his tools on his drawing board, close at hand.Unfortunately, reducing an interactive product to a list of hundreds of features doesn't lend itself to the kind of graceful orchestration that is required to make complex technology useful.Icon design and rendering is a craft in and of itself; rendering understandable images at low resolution takes considerable time and practice and is better left to trained visual designers.Adding a squirt of oil to a bicycle makes it pedal more easily, but that doesn’t mean that dumping a gallon of oil on it will make it pedal itself.When we want to find a spoon, for example, we go to the place where we keep our spoons. We don’t find the spoon by referring to any inherent characteristic of the spoon itself.Where the sovereign can dig a hole and pour a concrete foundation for itself, the transient application is just on a weekend campout. It cannot deploy itself onscreen either graphically or temporally. It is the taxicab of the software world.Any time your application finds itself with a choice, and especially when that choice is being offered to a user, the application should remember the information from run to run.The application is not asking us our opinion out of intellectual curiosity or desire to make conversation, the way a friend might over dinner.

Removing the toolbar itself is certainly a dislocating change to a persistent object.Transitory bulletins are sometimes used for error reporting. A program that launches an error message to report a problem may correct the problem itself or may detect that the problem has disappeared via some other agency.Returning to our discussion in Chapter 2, it’s absolutely critical that the represented model of the interface―how the design behaves and presents itself―should match the user’s mental model as closely as possible, rather than reflecting the implementation model of how the product is actually constructed internally.There are three basic ways to communicate―or hint at―the pliancy of an object to users: by creating static visual affordances of the object itself, by dynamically changing visual affordances of the object, or by changing the visual affordances of the cursor as it passes over and interacts with the object.A resizing idiom for graphical objects must be visually bold to differentiate itself from parts of the drawing, especially the object it controls, and it must not obscure the user’s view of the object and the area around it.The program rejects it with the same curt error message box. If instead the control were programmed to think of itself as a numeric entry control, it could perhaps behave better. It doesn’t bother me if the program converts the nine into a 9, but it certainly is incorrect when it says that nine is not a valid number.The document that was current at the time of the version selection will be created as a version itself. Also, since disk space is hardly a scarce resource these days, it makes sense to create versions regularly, in case it doesn’t occur to your users.The weakest way to offer the visual indication of receptivity to being dropped upon is by changing the cursor. It is the primary job of the cursor to represent what is being dragged. It is best to leave indication of drop candidacy to the drop candidate itself.---------------------end----------------------France itself was threatened with invasion.I digress.
